Why Spashta?
Most educational tools give the same explanation to everyone.

But people understand differently:

Some understand through games
Some through sports
Some through stories
Some through calm, spiritual analogies

Spashta adapts the explanation to the person, not the other way around.

Tagline
Spashta — Learn in the way you understand.
